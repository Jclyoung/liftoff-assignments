These are not set and it is me just looking at various ways I can style my project. 
I plan on doing the styles at the very end and until then just have basic menus and links.
If that is not okay, please let me know.

Updated to show user stories and stretch goals. I also put in what I would like to complete for each sprint.

Please let me know if this is better and any changes you think I should make.
