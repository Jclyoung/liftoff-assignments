## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I will be creating a website for a restaurant of a friend of mine.  His current website is a single page with links to pdfs to his menu and specials.  What I want to do for him is to create a site that allows users to create orders and pay for it online.  He will be able to add and organize three pages for his menu (apps, entrees, and drink specials).  I will also be including a working google map via their API and users will be able to create a login to sign up for promotions via SMS.  

This came about because I wanted a challenge in implementing a lot features I haven’t worked on before on a backbone I was familiar with to reinforce the ideas of how coding a website works in C#.


### Features

User Login - Users will be able to login and see their profile page to setup email and SMS messaging
SMS Messaging - Adding SMS emails for promotions to be sent out to registered users
Google maps api - Allows users to access the restaurant’s location via google maps
