### Overview

I will be creating a website for a card catalog for a freiend of mine.  He currently has no way to track 
what cards he has or where they are located.  What I want to do for him is to create a site that allows him to enter the cards he has and 
tracks where they are in his filing system. He will be able to add and organize various different card types. I want to create a method that
allows him to take pictures of the cards and populates the data. It will also be able to tell him what cards he is missing out of his
various sets of cards

My stretch goal is to create a mobile app for him to use as a easier and faster way for him to enter the his card catalog data
